Airbnb Clone - Console Project
Project Description
This initial phase of the Airbnb clone project focuses on developing and integrating the backend functionalities with a console application. The console application utilises the cmd module in Python to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend features. The generated data, represented as Python objects, is stored in a JSON file. The JSON module in Python is employed to facilitate data serialisation and deserialisation, ensuring seamless communication between the backend and console application.
